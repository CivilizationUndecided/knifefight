A first-person shooter we developed initially in a week for a challenge. We continued to develop and polish the game into a solid FPS framework.

The main two goals of this project are to dogfood for the engine, and produce libraries for the community.

## Libraries
- [facepunch.libevents](https://github.com/Facepunch/sbox-libevents) - an events library for broadcasting game events for other components / systems to listen to.

## Play the game on [s&box](https://sbox.game/facepunch/hc1)
